## House Price Prediction using Gradient Boosting
This repository contains a project I completed to predict house prices based on various features using a Gradient Boosting machine learning model. The goal of this project was to develop a model that can predict house prices accurately based on multiple input features such as the number of rooms, square footage, and more.

## My First Large Project
This is my first attempt at a large-scale project in the field of Data Science. I explored different steps in the data science pipeline, from data cleaning to model evaluation, and learned how to implement Gradient Boosting for a regression task.

## Steps Followed:
Data Loading and Exploration: I started by loading the dataset and performing initial exploration to understand the features and their distributions.

Data Preprocessing: I handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features for better performance of the model.

Model Selection: I selected the Gradient Boosting model for its strong performance in regression tasks. It is an ensemble technique that builds multiple weak models to create a powerful model.

Model Evaluation: The model was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score to ensure its accuracy in predicting house prices.

## Technologies Used:
Python

scikit-learn

Pandas

Numpy

## Outcome:
The model successfully predicted house prices with a decent accuracy, demonstrating the potential of using Gradient Boosting for regression tasks in real-world datasets.
